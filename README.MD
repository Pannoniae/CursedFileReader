# What is this unholy abomination?

This is (most of) the code taken from some other program.
It's just a code dump, no history is included for obvious reasons.

Some parts have been removed because I don't support cheating.

# But why?

To show off the most cursed input handling possible.

# How to run?

If you want that sweet sweet performance, use .NET 8, publish it as AOT, trimmed and select your OS as the target runtime.
